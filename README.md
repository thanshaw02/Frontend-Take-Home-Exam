# Frontend Take Home Exam
This repository contains source code written as a take-home exam for _Fetch Rewards_.

## How to run Create-User
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. From within the `create-user` directory run the `yarn start` command to spin the front-end up
3. Navigate to `localhost:3000` to view the main page

You may enter some data in one or more of the fields in the form you see, play around with how data is handled and how error/success messages are given to the user.

## How to format and/or lint this project
To format the codebase using standard formatting rules simply run `yarn format` from within the `create-user` directory.

To lint the codebase run the `yarn lint` command from within the `create-user` directory.

## Possible future changes
If I were to maintain this assignment or add onto it I'd like to add routing, using `React Router` to route the user to a home page or some page
that reads back the information they entered previously. Possibly allowing the user to confirm the data they have entered before fully pushing it up
to some endpoint.

I'd also like to spruce up the UI/UX a bit, make it look a bit prettier and add some animations or _::before_/_::after_ effects to the submit button. There were a few
design avenues I was originally going down but I opted for a more simple design and focused on the UX and file structure/cleanliness of the codebase.

# Final Thoughts
I really enjoy writing code and spending time refactoring it and seeing what really works or is easier to read, in this situation I'd tried to keep in mind 
reusability and maintainability. Building components that can be reused no matter the context is really important, I think it cuts down on duplicate/redundant code
but also makes your code easier to read and maintain.
